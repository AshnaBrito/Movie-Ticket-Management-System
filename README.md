Movie Ticket Management System

The Movie Ticket Management System is designed specifically for theater operators to streamline and manage movie schedules, seat availability, and ticket sales. 
This system simplifies day-to-day operations by offering real-time movie screening management, ticketing reports, and updates.
The system is divided into several modules, each responsible for a different aspect of the ticketing process, all neatly organized into folders for easy understanding and maintenance.
This project is distributed as a movie_ticket.zip file containing all source code, configuration files, and documentation.
